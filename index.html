<p style="font-size:2vw">I am just another bibliophile and an avid reader of Rumi, Sylvia Plath,Anne Sexton,Paulo Coelho,Jane Austen,Virginia Woolf and my most favourite author William Shakespeare.I find my happiness in writing and expressing my  tongue-tied emotions.Working with Music  is my passion. I make sure that I'm always listening to music,old and new artists, day in and day out to learn and to recreate what I really appreciate. I also love Sketching. I learnt this skill from my cousins. I met many kinds of people in my life . Most of them always Praise me for my skills and enthusiasm but there is always a dark side of every story that is filled with criticism and prejudice.<i>well be positive all the time</i> when your capabilities are below par, choose a playing ground that gives you a natural advantage.

If we recognise the power of faith, we won't look for miracles.<br><br><br><br>
<u>few words i want to scream in silence-</u> <br><br>
 <i>  Often we get overwhelmed by the challenges of the world as it seems to be humongous and unconquerable. We may feel like our actions are trivial. But this should not stop us from our attempt to create positive change in the world. We often forget and ignore the impact of our actions on the world. Sometimes even our tiniest act of kindness may be affecting someone in a great way.Life gives you strange experiences, sometime it shocks you and sometimes it may surprise you. We end up making wrong judgments or mistakes in our anger, desperation and frustration. However, when you get a second chance, correct your mistakes and return the favor. Be Kind and Generous. Learn to Appreciate what you are given.when your capabilities are below par, choose a playing ground that gives you a natural advantage.If we recognise the power of faith, we won't look for miracles.<br><br>
 
Fear deleted the respect.There is a thin line between Fear and Respect.Fear is the path to the Dark Side.Every one of us should understand it and do necessary corrections in our personalities.Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. </i>
